## Introduction
Hi everyone! Welcome to my blog.

I am a mobile developer, currently working for [Orange Business Services](http://www.orange-business.com/fr), passionate about iOS and Xamarin technologies! So here you will find blog posts on librairies and practices I love using throughout my projects. You'll also probably find blog posts boasting the superiority of my 2 favorite programming languages, Swift and C# :heart:
User experience is especially important in a mobile app: users will flee your app if it's UX is flawed. That is why I love integrating animations and elaborate user controls to my apps!

## Some of my professional projects
* [Pr√©fecture de police de Paris iOS application](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/pref.-police/id458318911?mt=8)
* iPad application for the sales representatives of a tobacco company (iOS 8 and Swift)
* Team communication iOS app with Push Notifications and app usage analytics using [Microsoft Azure](https://azure.microsoft.com/fr-fr/services/mobile-engagement/)
* iOS/Android/Windows 10 apps for Orange Business Services sales representatives using Xamarin.iOS and Xamarin.Android.
* Company "App Store" for Orange allow managers to install taylor-made applications for their business needs (made using Xamarin.iOS)
* WatchOS application for displaying information about a users driving trends in real time
* iOS 9 app that communicates with a device using Bluetooth Low Energy (BLE), glorious MVVM databinding and Swift 2
* Xamarin.Forms iPad form application used by sales representatives to collect data on their clients, and fill their client database with priceless information
* Windows 10 (Xamarin complient) application communicating with SAP services, used by factory workers in their quality control workflow
