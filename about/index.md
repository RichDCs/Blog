## Introduction
Hi everyone! Welcome to my blog.

I am a mobile developer, currently working for [Orange Business Services](http://www.orange-business.com/fr), passionate about <b>iOS</b> and <b>Xamarin</b> technologies! So here you will find blog posts on librairies and practices I love using throughout my projects.

You'll also probably find blog posts boasting the superiority of my 2 favorite programming languages, <b>Swift</b> and <b>C#</b> <3

User experience is especially important in a mobile app: users will flee your app if it's UX is flawed. That is why I love integrating <b>animations and elaborate user controls</b> to my apps!

## Some of my professional projects
* [Pr√©fecture de police de Paris iOS application](https://itunes.apple.com/fr/app/pref.-police/id458318911?mt=8)
* iPad application for the sales representatives of a tobacco company (<b>iOS 8 and Swift</b>)
